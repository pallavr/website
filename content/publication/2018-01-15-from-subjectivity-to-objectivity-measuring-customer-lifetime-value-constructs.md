This post is about my first publication in a local journal on outlining the contributions of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to marketing within a firm. Customer Lifetime Value is where my infatuation towards data science and likeness towards data science all began. I didn't even know about CLV until I was asked to present on it in my marketing strategy class by my professor, Dr. Banerjee. That lead me to an article called "Modeling Customer Lifetime Value" by Gupta et al (2006). That article had opened my eyes to a fascinating world of quantitative marketing and customer relationship management (CRM).

**Overview**

Here is a link to my [article](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.741.7971&rep=rep1&type=pdf). It gives a gentle introduction to how CLV fits into the marketing machinery. Then the article focuses on the issue of balancing acquisition and retention expenses and how CLV easily helps to address the issue. I even go on to prove this with a hypothetical example that shows how CLV, even in its most simplest form, can capture the problem of balancing cost and guide managers in decision making. This is just one of the several uses of CLV as a marketing metric. CLV has evolved tremendously evolved over the years.

**Abstract**

As data drives decision making in business more and more, it becomes essential to objectify
key market metrics such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). CLV is the value added by a customer
to a firm’s profits during its association with the firm’s products or services. Therefore it becomes
important for firms to employ suitable strategies to prolong a customer’s lifetime. In this paper
we have taken this subjective aspect of CLV and given it a measurement. We have used this
measurement to establish a connection between customer satisfaction and maximization of
ROI. Next we have again used this measurement to compare three different marketing strategies
in a market driven firm.

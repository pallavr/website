abstract = "As data drives decision making in business more and more, it becomes essential to objectify
key market metrics such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). CLV is the value added by a customer
to a firm’s profits during its association with the firm’s products or services. Therefore it becomes
important for firms to employ suitable strategies to prolong a customer’s lifetime. In this paper
we have taken this subjective aspect of CLV and given it a measurement. We have used this
measurement to establish a connection between customer satisfaction and maximization of
ROI. Next we have again used this measurement to compare three different marketing strategies
in a market driven firm."

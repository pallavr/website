<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<pre><code>In the presence of multiple causes of exit, a customer’s survival propensity due to a specific cause is affected by all other competing causes of churn. Consequently, the worth of a customer within such a firm would also be affected by these competing forces. Therefore, the lifetime value for such customers must incorporate this competing information. In this paper, we implement a Competing Risk model for estimating the worth of a customer who faces simultaneous risks of temporary or permanent disengagement of membership from the firm. To overcome the limitations of traditional semi-parametric modeling approaches we implement a Random Survival Forest model to predict the survival probability of customer influenced by competing causes of churn. In doing so, we extend the literature on prediction of survival probabilities beyond non-competing scenarios. By the same token, we also extend the literature on customer relationship valuation under contractual business settings in the presence of multiple causes of churn. We demonstrate analytical insights that (i) investigate factors that contribute to a specific cause of churn (ii) reflect the trade-offs between predicted risk and customer value (iii) segment the predicted customer valuation curves over time (iv) study the behavior of predictor variables within such segments. Finally we utilize the prediction and analytical results to optimize the marketing-budget allocation within these customer valuation segments thereby bridging the gap between predictive and prescriptive analytics.</code></pre>

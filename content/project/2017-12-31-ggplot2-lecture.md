Never thought I'd have the opportunity to deliver a lecture on ggplot2 but thanks to [BASIC](https://www.bgsu.edu/business/students/student-organizations/basic--business-analytics-student-informs-chapter-.html) I got the opportunity. There was healthy crowd which initially did make me nervous but I was able to focus on the task at hand and teach the basics of the wonderful package. 

It was an hour long lecture where I covered the basics of ggplot2: the 'layer' composition of a ggplot, the hist, bar and point geom along with an advanced topic of 'tidying' the data. Overall it was a fun experience and I was able to learn a lot from it myself. I hope the lecture was able to motivate fellow falcons to move away from base plotting system in R and explore the powerful ggplot2.

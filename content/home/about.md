# Biography

I recieved my BS in Chemistry and a post graduate diploma in Marketing Management from St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, India. While doing my diploma, I became interested in Customer Relationship Management and the fascinating world of predictive and prescriptive analytics. I decided to pursue my MS in Applied Statistics and Operation Research at Bowling Green State University here in the US. My passion for data science was instigated by my love for R. Altough I love Python too, I have a soft spot for R and the powerful Hadley Wickham packages.

I love sharing. I love sharing what I learn. I have been extremely lucky thus far in my life to be able to do what I love but I realize that there are countless people from all over the world who cannot follow their passion. This website is primaryly for them. Every tutorial on this website is made with the intention of reaching out to a wide variety of audience. I'm a huge fan of intuitive learning and I try to justify whatever I learn with intuition. To me, understanding what's going on is more important than grades. This site also helps me collect all my thoughts and what I have learn during my classes. A unique aspect of this website is the combination of predictive and prescriptive analytics. This helps paint a more complete picture of the entire process of predicting the future and prescribing actions. I hope you enjoy reading my work and is able to benefit from it.

# Biography

Before my masters, I recieved a BS in Chemistry and a post graduate diploma in Marketing Management from St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, India. During my diploma, I became interested in Customer Relationship Management and the fascinating world of predictive and prescriptive analytics. I decided to pursue an MS in Applied Statistics and Operations Research at Bowling Green State University here in the US.

I am passionate about data science. There's something about rows and columns of unrelated data that excites me and urges me to analyze it. But, my passion for data science was instigated by my love for R. R was the first ``programming" language that I learnt and it fueled my passion for doing research in area of quantitative marketing. So, although  I also love Python, I have a soft spot for R and the powerful Hadley Wickham packages.

A year ago, when I heard Mark Zuckerburg's powerful speech at Harvard, one specific part of the speech inspired me the most,

`I'm here to tell you finding your purpose isn't enough. The challenge for our generation is creating a world where everyone has a sense of purpose..`

I realized that I have been extremely lucky thus far in my life to be able to do what I want. There are countless people (some perhaps more deserving than the fortunate fraction like me) from all over the world who cannot follow their passion. This website is for them. I hope what I publish here helps someone else find his/her passion (in data science).

Every tutorial on this website is made with the intention of reaching out to a wide variety of audience. I'm a huge fan of intuitive learning and I try to justify whatever I learn with intuition. To me, understanding what's going on is more important than grades. This site also helps me collect all my thoughts and what I have learn during my classes. A unique aspect of this website is the combination of predictive and prescriptive analytics. This helps paint a more complete picture of the entire process of predicting the future and prescribing actions. I hope you enjoy reading my work and you're able to benefit from it.
